# AutoCO-Automated-Constraint-Optimization-via-LLM-driven-bidirectional-coevolution
we introduce AutoCO (Automated Constraint Optimization via LLM-driven bidirectional coevolution), an innovative solution that positions LLMs as proactive strategy designers for COPs (see Figure 1C). AutoCO enables LLMs to explicitly explore and optimize constraint relaxation strategies as integral components in the algorithm design process.
