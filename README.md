# AutoCO: Automated Constraint Optimization via LLM-driven Bidirectional Coevolution

## üéØ Core Innovation

Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization has recently shown promise for autonomous problem solving, yet most approaches still cast LLMs as passive constraint checkers rather than proactive strategy designers, limiting their effectiveness on complex Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs).

**The Fundamental Challenge**: Most real-world COPs are NP-hard, with complexity arising from hard constraints that create conflicting decisions and global dependencies. These constraints fragment the feasible region, complicating the solution process and underscoring the necessity for efficient and high-quality solutions. As hard constraints increase, obtaining feasible solutions becomes more difficult, resulting in ineffective feedback that can lead to unguided search processes producing suboptimal designs.

### Our Solution: AutoCO Framework

To address these challenges, we present **AutoCO**, an end-to-end **Auto**mated **C**onstraint **O**ptimization method that tightly couples operations-research principles of constraint relaxation with LLM reasoning. AutoCO enables LLMs to explicitly explore and optimize constraint relaxation strategies as integral components in the algorithm design process, positioning them as proactive strategy designers rather than passive validators.

**Transformative Approach**: Unlike existing LLM methods that primarily rely on feedback from feasible solutions and lack detailed problem analysis, AutoCO integrates the world knowledge, reasoning, and strategy search capabilities of LLMs with constraint relaxation principles through three complementary innovations:

## üöÄ Key Contributions

### 1. Triple-Representation Scheme
A core innovation is a **unified triple-representation** that maintains synchronized evolution across three coupled components:
- **Relaxation Strategies**: Constraint-specific relaxation coefficients and modification approaches
- **Algorithmic Principles**: High-level algorithm design concepts and optimization methodologies  
- **Executable Codes**: Fully implemented solver implementations ready for execution

This design enables the LLM to synthesize, justify, and instantiate relaxation strategies that are both principled and executable. The unified representation ensures that each generated solver explicitly employs its corresponding constraint relaxation strategy to solve the optimization problem, bridging the structural modeling gap in conventional approaches.

### 2. Bidirectional Global-Local Coevolution Mechanism
To navigate fragmented solution spaces and address the vast strategy decision space, AutoCO employs a **bidirectional coevolution mechanism**, synergistically coupling:

- **Global Exploration**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for systematic relaxation-trajectory exploration and global strategy guidance
- **Local Intensification**: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) for fine-grained solution refinement and local optimization

This continuous exchange of priors and feedback explicitly balances diversification and intensification, thus preventing premature convergence. The mechanism delegates fine-grained optimization of strategy-concepts-code triples to the local EA layer, while the global MCTS layer explores the global strategy space to identify promising directions.

### 3. LLM-Driven Constraint Relaxation Methodology
We propose a structured three-step relaxation method that transforms expert-dependent constraint handling into an LLM-driven automated approach:

- **Constraint Importance Analysis**: LLM-powered parsing to identify constraints and assign context-aware importance weights
- **Relaxation Range Suggestion**: Adaptive determination of relaxation factor ranges based on constraint criticality
- **Strategy Generation**: Systematic synthesis of diverse relaxation strategies adhering to constraint structures
